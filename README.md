# 🧪 Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

This project demonstrates how to capture, filter, and analyze live network traffic using **Wireshark**. Conducted as part of *OMIS 660 – Business Data Networks & Cybersecurity*, it focuses on understanding how protocols such as HTTP, TCP, DNS, TLS, and QUIC interact within real network sessions.

---

## 📘 Objective
- Capture live packets on the Wi-Fi interface.
- Observe HTTP GET and HTTP 200 OK exchanges.
- Identify client and server IP addresses.
- Measure round-trip response times.
- Explore DNS, TLS, and QUIC traffic for secure and modern protocol behavior.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Wireshark v4.x**
- **macOS / Windows**
- **Browser:** Safari
- **File Format:** `.pcapng`

---

## 🔍 Key Learnings
- Understood the layered network structure (Ethernet → IP → TCP → HTTP).
- Applied display filters to isolate specific protocol traffic.
- Observed TCP handshakes, DNS lookups, and TLS encryption setup.
- Measured and analyzed HTTP response times (~0.03 seconds).
